Profinet is an industrial Ethernet protocol designed for real-time communication in automation systems.
It primarily operates at the Data Link Layer (Layer 2) and Application Layer (Layer 7) of the OSI model, with specific characteristics that allow it to support real-time and deterministic communication.

When we say Profinet operates at Layer 2 of the OSI model, it means that the communication between devices in a Profinet network primarily occurs at the Data Link Layer (Layer 2),
which is below the Network Layer (Layer 3) of the OSI model.

Profinet and Layer 2 Communication

Profinet, the industrial Ethernet protocol for automation, uses Ethernet (Layer 2) for communication, which allows it to bypass higher-level IP protocols. Here’s what this means in the context of Profinet:

    Direct Communication via Ethernet Frames:
        Profinet devices communicate directly using Ethernet frames, which contain the MAC addresses of the sender and receiver. This means Profinet does not rely on the Network Layer (Layer 3) and the IP protocol for basic communication.
        Devices on the same local network (LAN) can communicate with each other using Ethernet frames without needing to use IP addresses, which would be required if communication were taking place over different networks or subnetworks.

    Bypassing IP:
        In typical IP-based communication (e.g., HTTP or TCP/IP), IP addresses are used to route packets between different devices and networks. However, Profinet uses Ethernet MAC addresses to directly identify devices in the local network. As a result, Profinet devices don't rely on Layer 3 protocols like IP for device discovery or initial configuration.
        This design reduces the overhead associated with IP-based communication, making Profinet more efficient for real-time and time-sensitive industrial automation applications, where minimizing latency and overhead is critical.

    Profinet's Operation at Layer 2:
        DCP (Discovery and Configuration Protocol): This is a key protocol in Profinet that works at Layer 2. It is used during the initial phase of the Profinet device's operation to discover devices and configure network parameters (like the device's name and IP address). DCP sends Ethernet frames that contain requests to all devices in the network to identify themselves.
        Since DCP operates at Layer 2, it can send broadcast messages over the network, which are received by all devices. Devices respond with information like their MAC address, name, and IP address.

    Real-Time Communication:
        Profinet can also use real-time (RT) and Isochronous Real-Time (IRT) communication, which requires very low latency. These real-time communications are handled over Ethernet frames, with precise timing and synchronization, ensuring critical data (like control signals) is exchanged between devices without delays. Layer 2 allows these communications to happen with minimal overhead compared to IP-based communication.

    Reduced Complexity:
        By operating at Layer 2, Profinet can simplify the network configuration and reduce the need for complex routing decisions. All devices can communicate with each other directly using MAC addresses, and there’s no need to worry about IP address management or routing protocols for local network communication.

In Layer 2 communication (Data Link Layer), devices can still find and communicate with each other without the need for routing or IP addresses. This is achieved through the use of MAC addresses (Media Access Control addresses), which are unique hardware identifiers assigned to network interfaces. Here’s how it works in the context of Profinet and Layer 2 communication:
1. MAC Addresses:

Each device in a network has a unique MAC address assigned to its network interface card (NIC). These MAC addresses are used for direct communication between devices on the same local network or LAN.

    MAC address: A 48-bit address (usually represented in hexadecimal) that uniquely identifies a network interface.
    In Layer 2 communication, the MAC address is the primary identifier for devices on the network.

2. Ethernet Frames and Direct Communication:

In Layer 2, devices send Ethernet frames to communicate. Each frame contains:

    Destination MAC address: The MAC address of the device receiving the message.
    Source MAC address: The MAC address of the device sending the message.
    Data (payload): The actual data being transmitted.
    Error-checking data: To ensure the integrity of the data.

When one device wants to send data to another, it uses the destination MAC address to indicate which device should receive the frame. Here’s how devices communicate using Ethernet frames:

    Unicast: If the sender knows the MAC address of the target device, it can send a frame directly to that device (unicast).
    Broadcast: If the sender does not know the MAC address of the target device, it can send a broadcast frame to all devices in the local network. All devices on the network receive the frame, but only the one with the matching MAC address will process it.
    Multicast: Similar to broadcast but intended for a specific group of devices.

3. Device Discovery (DCP in Profinet):

Although Layer 2 communication does not require IP addresses for communication on a local network, device discovery is still possible using DCP (Discovery and Configuration Protocol) in Profinet, which operates at Layer 2. Here's how it works:

    DCP Request: A device sends a DCP request (such as a broadcast or multicast frame) to the network asking for information about available Profinet devices. Since it’s a broadcast frame, all devices on the local network will receive it.
    DCP Response: Devices that recognize the request respond with their MAC address and other identification information, such as their device name, model, or capabilities.
    The sending device then collects the responses and identifies devices in the network based on their MAC addresses.

So, the communication is still happening at Layer 2 (Ethernet frames), but device discovery is achieved through broadcast or multicast messages to locate devices based on their MAC addresses.
4. How Devices Find Each Other in Layer 2 Communication:

    Device Discovery: As mentioned, devices can discover each other using broadcasts or multicasts (in case of Profinet’s DCP). For instance:
        Profinet Master might broadcast a DCP request asking for all available devices in the network.
        Profinet Slaves that hear this request respond with their MAC addresses and other details.
        Once devices identify each other, they can establish communication using unicast Ethernet frames (since the sender knows the destination MAC address).
    Ethernet Switches: Devices connected to the network usually communicate via Ethernet switches. The switches maintain a MAC address table (sometimes called a forwarding table) that helps them forward Ethernet frames to the correct device.
        When a device sends an Ethernet frame to another device using the destination MAC address, the switch looks up the MAC address in its table to figure out which port the frame should be forwarded to.
        If the destination MAC address is not in the table, the switch will forward the frame to all connected devices (broadcast) until it finds the correct one.

5. Profinet and Layer 2 Communication Without IP:

In the case of Profinet, devices on the same local network use Layer 2 communication without the need for IP addresses. The process goes as follows:

    Device Discovery: A Profinet device, typically a Master, will broadcast a request (DCP) to discover available Slaves.
    DCP Protocol: The devices respond to the DCP request with their MAC addresses, device names, and other configuration data. This allows the Master to identify and configure the Slave devices.
    Configuration: Once the devices are discovered, the Master and Slave devices communicate with each other using their MAC addresses for the duration of the communication.

6. The Role of IP in Profinet:

While Layer 2 communication handles local communication (discovery, configuration, etc.), Profinet can still use Layer 3 (IP) for communication across subnets or networks (for example, for remote devices). Here’s when IP comes into play:

    Once a Profinet Master identifies the devices via Layer 2 and they need to communicate across different networks or subnets, IP addresses are used for routing packets.
    IP addresses are used when Profinet devices are part of a larger network that spans multiple subnets.

Summary:

    MAC addresses allow devices to directly communicate at Layer 2 without needing IP addresses.
    Broadcast or multicast frames are used to discover devices in the same local network.
    Ethernet switches facilitate communication by forwarding Ethernet frames to the correct destination MAC address.
    DCP (Discovery and Configuration Protocol) in Profinet uses Layer 2 communication (broadcasting requests and receiving responses based on MAC addresses) for device discovery and configuration.
    IP addresses are used when Profinet devices need to communicate across different networks or subnets (Layer 3).

Thus, even without IP or routing, devices can find and communicate with each other in Layer 2 communication using MAC addresses and Ethernet frames.

1. Layer 2 is Limited to Local Networks

Layer 2 communication (based on MAC addresses and Ethernet frames):

    Does not support communication across different networks (subnets).
    Devices on one local network cannot directly communicate with devices on another network because MAC addresses are only meaningful within a single LAN.
    No routing capability: Layer 2 cannot decide how to forward data beyond the local network.

Higher layers, especially Layer 3 (Network Layer), introduce:

    IP addresses that provide unique identifiers across networks.
    Routing protocols to determine the best path for data to travel between distant networks.

Without these, devices on separate subnets or networks would be isolated.

2. Lack of End-to-End Communication in Layer 2

In Layer 2:

    Communication is limited to devices that are physically connected or part of the same LAN segment.
    There’s no mechanism to ensure data delivery over complex, multi-hop paths.

Higher layers (e.g., Layer 4 - Transport Layer) provide:

    Reliable delivery mechanisms (e.g., TCP) to ensure data arrives correctly, even over long distances or lossy networks.
    Error recovery and retransmission in case of packet loss.

5. Lack of Security and Data Integrity

Layer 2 communication:

    Lacks encryption: Data in Ethernet frames can be intercepted and read by any device on the same LAN.
    Lacks authentication: There’s no way to verify that the sender or receiver is legitimate.

Higher layers add:

    Encryption (TLS, SSL) at Layer 6/7 to protect data during transmission.
    Authentication and Authorization at Layer 7 to ensure only trusted parties can communicate.

6. No Port-Based Communication in Layer 2

Layer 2 communication does not distinguish between different applications running on the same device. For example:

    If two applications on the same device want to communicate, Layer 2 cannot differentiate between their traffic.

Layer 4 introduces:

    Ports to identify different applications or services (e.g., port 80 for HTTP, port 443 for HTTPS).
    Multiplexing to handle multiple communication streams simultaneously.

4. Why Doesn’t Profinet Use Higher OSI Layers?

Profinet avoids higher OSI layers (Layer 3 and above) to achieve:

    Deterministic communication: Critical for real-time control in industrial environments.
    Low latency: Higher layers introduce additional overhead, which increases delays.
    Simplicity: Layer 2 communication is sufficient for many industrial automation tasks, where devices are usually located on the same local network.
