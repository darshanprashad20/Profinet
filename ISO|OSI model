User A wants to send an email to User B. The email will pass through all 7 layers of the OSI model during its journey from the sender's device to the recipient's device.
1. Physical Layer (Layer 1) – Transmission of Data (Electrical, Optical Signals):

    Real-World Action:
        User A's device (like a laptop or smartphone) sends the email data as electrical signals (or light signals if fiber-optic is used) through the physical medium (Wi-Fi, Ethernet, or cellular network).
    Example:
        The data is transmitted as bits (0s and 1s) via a Wi-Fi network or through cables connecting the computer to a router or modem.
    Real-World Device:
        Wireless router, network cables, modem, and physical interfaces.

2. Data Link Layer (Layer 2) – Framing and Error Handling:

    Real-World Action:
        The email data is packaged into "frames," which contain not only the raw data but also error detection codes (to check for transmission errors) and the MAC address (hardware address) of the sending and receiving devices.
    Example:
        The router at User A's location receives the electrical signals, creates frames, and checks for errors in transmission.
    Real-World Device:
        Network Interface Cards (NICs), Wi-Fi access points, Ethernet switches.

3. Network Layer (Layer 3) – Routing and Logical Addressing (IP):

    Real-World Action:
        The data needs to travel over multiple networks to reach User B, so it's routed using IP addresses. User A's email server knows the IP address of User B's email server.
    Example:
        User A’s email goes through various routers (which use IP addresses) on the internet, determining the best path (routing) based on the destination address.
    Real-World Device:
        Routers, firewalls, gateways.

4. Transport Layer (Layer 4) – End-to-End Communication:

    Real-World Action:
        The email service uses protocols like TCP to ensure the email is delivered correctly from User A to User B. If any data is lost or corrupted during transmission, it is retransmitted.
    Example:
        The email client on User A's device divides the email into smaller segments, adds sequencing numbers, and ensures they arrive in the correct order on User B's side.
        TCP ensures reliable communication by acknowledging receipt of segments.
    Real-World Protocol:
        TCP (Transmission Control Protocol).

5. Session Layer (Layer 5) – Maintaining Sessions:

    Real-World Action:
        A session is established between the two email servers to maintain communication. The session stays open until the email has been successfully transferred, ensuring that the two systems can talk back and forth.
    Example:
        If the email is large, the session remains active until all segments of the email are sent and received correctly. Once the transfer is complete, the session is terminated.
    Real-World Protocol:
        SMTP (Simple Mail Transfer Protocol) for email, or IMAP/POP3 for retrieving email.

6. Presentation Layer (Layer 6) – Data Translation and Encryption:

    Real-World Action:
        At this layer, the email data is formatted for the recipient's email system. It may also be encrypted for security purposes, especially if the email contains sensitive information.
    Example:
        The email body and any attachments (like images or documents) are encoded into a format that can be properly read by the recipient's email client. If the email is encrypted, this layer ensures that only the recipient can read it.
    Real-World Protocol:
        SSL/TLS for email encryption, MIME (Multipurpose Internet Mail Extensions) for email formatting.

7. Application Layer (Layer 7) – User Interaction:

    Real-World Action:
        User A interacts with an email client (like Outlook, Gmail, or Apple Mail) to compose and send the email. Similarly, User B will use their email client to read the incoming message.
    Example:
        User A types the message, attaches files, and hits "Send." The email client communicates with the email server using SMTP to send the email to User B. User B retrieves and reads the email using their own email client through IMAP or POP3.
    Real-World Protocol:
        SMTP (Simple Mail Transfer Protocol) for sending emails, POP3/IMAP for receiving and accessing emails.

Visualizing the Entire Journey:

    User A’s email client sends the email via SMTP, which interacts with the Transport Layer (TCP), and the Network Layer (IP) to reach the recipient.
    The email passes through various routers and network devices, with each layer ensuring the data is properly formatted, routed, and transmitted.
    The Presentation Layer handles data translation and encryption (if applicable).
    Finally, User B’s email client on the recipient's end receives and displays the message using the Application Layer.

Key Points to Remember:

    Each layer has a specific function and interacts with the adjacent layers (above and below).
    Lower layers handle the mechanics of data transmission (e.g., physical medium, routing, and error handling).
    Higher layers deal with the application logic (e.g., how the data is presented, formatted, and interacted with by users).
