PROFINET
Profinet is an open industrial ethernet solution based on international standards(IEC 61158). 
used to communicate between device and controllers for automation
Profinet is an openstandard.
Profinet defines cyclic and acyclic communication between components, including diagnostics, functional safety, alarms and additional information.
to link all those components profinet employs standard unmodified ethernet for its communicatoin medium.
high speed and deterministic messages. Deterministic communication means delivering message exactly when they are expected

profinet is a communication protocol that lives at layer seven of the ISO/OSI model.
7. Application layer
6. Presentation layer
5. session layer
4. Transport layer
3. Network layer
2. Data link layer 
1. Physical layer

profinet can do TCP/IP and UDP/IP based communication for non time critical task, such as configuration and parameterization.
due to the potential latency and delays associated with IP based communication
